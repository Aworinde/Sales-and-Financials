# Sales-and-Financials
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales and profitability across countries, products, and customer segments. Delivered executive KPIs, identified profit drivers and loss-making segments, and revealed seasonal and discount impacts using robust data modeling and DAX.

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes company-wide sales and financial performance across countries, products, customer segments, and time.

The goal of the project is to provide stakeholders with an interactive tool to monitor KPIs, evaluate profitability drivers, and identify areas for strategic optimization.

## Business Objective

To evaluate:
  * Revenue performance across markets
  * Profitability by product and customer segment
  * Impact of discount strategies on financial outcomes
  * Monthly sales and profit trends
  * Geographic contribution to overall performance

The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making for pricing, market expansion, and operational optimization.

## Key KPIs

The dashboard focuses on the following core performance indicators:
  * Total Sales: 118.73M
  * Total Cost: 101.83M
  * Total Profit: 16.89M
  * Units Sold: 1M
  * Number of Products: 6
  * Countries Covered: 5

These KPIs provide a high-level snapshot of business health and operational scale.

## Business Questions Addressed

This analysis was designed to answer key business questions such as:
  * Which countries contribute the most to total sales and profit?
  * How does profit vary across customer segments?
  * Which products generate the highest profit?
  * What is the relationship between discount levels and sales performance?
  * How do sales and profits trend across months?
  * Are there segments or markets generating losses despite high sales?

## Key Insights
### 1. Geographic Performance
  - USA and Canada are the top contributors, each accounting for over 21% of total sales.
  - Mexico contributes the lowest share (17.76%), indicating potential for growth or strategic reevaluation.

### 2. Sales vs Profit by Country
  While sales volumes are relatively balanced across countries, profit margins vary, suggesting differences in cost structures or discount strategies.

### 3. Profit by Segment
  - Government and Small Business segments are the most profitable.
  - The Enterprise segment shows a loss (-0.6M), highlighting inefficiencies or aggressive discounting.
  - Midmarket and Channel Partners contribute positively but at smaller margins.

### 4. Discount Band Analysis
  Medium (33%) and High (31%) discount bands dominate sales volume. This indicates strong reliance on discounting, which may be impacting overall profitability.

### 5. Product Performance
  - Paseo is the most profitable product.
  - VTT and Amarilla also perform strongly.
  - Lower-performing products may require repositioning or cost optimization.

### 6. Monthly Trends
  - Sales peak in October (22M), with strong performance also in December (17M).
  - Profit follows a similar trend, indicating seasonal demand spikes.
  - August shows the lowest sales and profit, suggesting a seasonal slowdown.

## Business Impact
  * Identifies loss-making segments (Enterprise) that require immediate attention.
  * Highlights high-performing products and regions for investment prioritization.
  * Provides evidence to reassess discount strategies, especially in high-discount bands.
  * Supports data-driven planning for seasonality and demand forecasting.
  * Data-backed portfolio optimization.

## Power BI Skills Demonstrated
 ### DAX Measures
  - Total Sales
  - Total Profit
  - Profit Margin %
  - Dynamic KPI calculations
  - Time intelligence (Monthly trend analysis)

 ### Visualization Best Practices

  - Cross-filtering between visuals
  - Dynamic filtering by country and segment

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive financial performance view across multiple business dimensions. While the company maintains positive overall profitability, deeper analysis reveals:
  - Segment-level inefficiencies
  - Discount-driven margin pressure
  - Seasonal sales patterns

By leveraging these insights, stakeholders can refine pricing strategies, optimize product focus, and strengthen long-term profitability.

## Future Enhancements

  * Add drill-through pages for product-level deep dives
  * Deploy to Power BI Service for stakeholder sharing
